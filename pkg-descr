Port of the one-context package which allows contextualisation of FreeBSD
VMs created using OpenNebula.

This port supports the mounting of the contextualisation CD, export of
context variables defined in OpenNebula templates and the execution of
scripts to perform the contextualisation.

Included contextualisation scripts emulate those built into the official
debian one-context package and take care of networking, DNS, SSH key
installation, mounting of swap partitions and execution of any included
init.sh.
